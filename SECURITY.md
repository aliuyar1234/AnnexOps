# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

- Preferred: use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security → "Report a vulnerability").
- If that is not available: contact the repository owner via the email address listed on their GitHub profile.

Include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible)
- Affected versions/branches
